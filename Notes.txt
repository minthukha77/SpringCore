For create Bean and for use 

    1.Create a Java Bean 

    2.@Config Bean in Confid file 

    3.Autowired in controller 

 

 Bean has lifecycles.
    @PostConstruct
    public void init(){
        log.info("PostConstuct Example bean");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void destroy(){
        log.info("@PreDestroy Example Bean");
    }


    After created bean, need to register immediately services and code
    must place on @PostConstruct





    What means Singleton bean?

    It is a class and one instance. This one instance will be used in everywhere in the entire
    whole application. This is singleton.


    Class: You define a class, like MyService.
    Instance: Spring creates only one object (instance) of that class.
    Usage: This one instance is shared and used everywhere in your application, whenever the class is needed.



    Singleton beans can face problem in session.

    For example,

        In a shopping cart, cart class is one class exists. But share entire application.
        But, customers are different. So, same session error can possible.

        So, we need to add @SessionScope on ShoppingCart class. 

        It can solve error.
